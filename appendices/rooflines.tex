    \caption[Roofline charts for all operators]{Full set of visualizations showing roofline charts per operator (A40 GPU). Note: the transpose column summation figure should look like the row summation (non transpose) figure. It is similar to the regular column sums due to a big in the implementation that has since been resolved. This does not affect the runtime scenarios for ML models as this operator is not used in any of the tested models.}
