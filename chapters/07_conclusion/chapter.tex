\section{Cost Estimation for Factorized Machine Learning}

\todo{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GPUs have very different cost characteristics than CPUs.
        \item Existing methods are not accurate for GPUs.
        \item We show that our cost model is more accurate than existing methods.
    \end{itemize}
}

\section{Future Work}
\todo{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement in established ML framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
        \item Exploring distributed setting
        \item Exploring micro benchmark \& online training
        \item Profiling and optimization (profile Full ML model and use that to enrich feature set for cost estimation).
    \end{itemize}
