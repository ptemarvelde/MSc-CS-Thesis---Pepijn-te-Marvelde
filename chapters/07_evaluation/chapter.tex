\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chapter:evaluation-discussion}
This chapter shows Contribution \textbf{C.2}: A robust cost estimator for Amalur's factorized ML framework, and a comparison with the state-of-the-art in \autoref{sec:7-model-evaluation}. The \hyperref[sec:7-discussion]{second section} of this chapter provides an in-depth interpretation of the results as well as a critical view on the implications and limitations of this work.

\section{Cost Model Performance and Comparative Analysis}
\label{sec:7-model-evaluation}

In this section we answer
\begin{itemize}
    \item[RQ.2] How can we accurately predict the optimal choice between factorized or materialized training of a Machine Learning model, on CPU and GPU, through leveraging knowledge about model, data, and hardware characteristics?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exploring Generalizability}
\subsubsection{Performance with New Datasets}

\subsubsection{Ablation Study}


\subsection{Cost Estimator Comparison}


\section{Discussion}
