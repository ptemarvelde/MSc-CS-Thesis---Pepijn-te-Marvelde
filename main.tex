\begin{abstract}
    \addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
    In the realm of machine learning (ML), the need for efficiency in training processes is paramount. The conventional first step in an ML workflow involves collecting data from various sources and merging them into a single table, a process known as materialization, which can introduce inefficiencies caused by redundant data. Factorized ML strives to reduce this redundancy by maintaining the original data forms and performing model training on the separate source tables. This approach can lead to significant increases in training efficiency.

    However, the cost of training with factorized ML is not always lower than with traditional materialized learning. This research tackles this issue by examining the multidimensional cost optimization problem that emerges when deciding between factorized and traditional materialized learning methods. It fills in gaps left by prior research, which is focused on CPU-based training, by investigating the cost estimation landscape for factorized ML, with a special emphasis on GPU performance compared to CPUs. The factorized ML framework is expanded to incorporate GPU training, a topic not explored in previous research. We demonstrate that GPU training exhibits significantly different cost characteristics than CPU training, which has substantial implications for the design of cost models and the optimization of factorized ML.

    Through an empirical study, an ML-based cost model is developed that can accurately predict the faster training method for a wide range of scenarios. On an extensive evaluation with real-world datasets this model boasts an average speedup of $3.8\times$, versus the state-of-the-art's $0.9\times$. We also show that it is generalizable to scenarios with datasets and hardware settings on which the model is not trained, keeping 82\% of training set performance.

    Our innovative cost model for factorized machine learning enables significant time savings in training-intensive scenarios and further underlines the benefits of factorized ML. However, effort should be invested into incorporating factorized training into existing ML frameworks so this method of training a model, and our cost model, can be evaluated in a larger set of realistic scenarios.

    I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Rihan Hai for their guidance and encouragement as my supervisor throughout this thesis. I am also very thankful for Wenbo Sun's constructive feedback, valuable insights, and the guidance he provided. Their ideas and perspectives greatly enriched this study. I also express my gratitude to Dr. Asterios Katsifodimos and Dr. Soham Chakraborty for serving on my thesis committee.

    My sincere thanks go to my family and friends for their unwavering support, patience, and understanding during this thesis. Their encouragement and occasional distractions were invaluable.

    Lastly, the research reported in this work was partially facilitated by computational resources and support of the Delft AI Cluster (DAIC) at TU Delft (\url{https://daic.tudelft.nl/}), but remains the sole responsibility of the authors, not the DAIC team.
